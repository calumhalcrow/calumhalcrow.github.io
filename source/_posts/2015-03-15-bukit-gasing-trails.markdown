Bukit Gasing Trails was a website I created showing the various hiking trails that exist in the [Bukit Gasing Forest Park](http://www.bukitgasing.org/bukitgasingforestpark.htm).

<!-- more -->

At the time the site was built only partial information about trail routes was available online. However, in recent years the park's trails and points of interest have been added to [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/3.0974/101.6570). Since OSM provides more information and will continue to do so (given its crowd-sourced nature) I have decided to bring Bukit Gasing Trails down.

The site's source code is still [available on Github](https://github.com/calumhalcrow/bukit-gasing-trails). Building it exposed me to the world of static websites generators like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and to the Google Maps API. If you'd like to see what the site looked like, here it is:
