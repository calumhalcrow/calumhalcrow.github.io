Part of my forward looking plans have been to migrate [calumhalcrow.com](http://calumhalcrow.com)
onto a static blogging platform, therefore having more control over the code that drives it.

I decided to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org) (with the [CleanPress](https://github.com/macjasp/cleanpress) theme)
hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Such a setup gives me a static blogging engine, hosted for free,
with full control over my site yet with almost embarrassingly minimal setup work involved.

And this is it.
