Hi, my name is Calum and I'm a programmer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

I was born and brought up in [Shetland](http://shetland.org), Scotland. I studied Mathematics at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk), but after graduating felt a change of direction was necessary so [moved into web development](http://nbcommunication.com) and programming. My wife and I settled in her [home country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) and currently live in Kuala Lumpur.

I currently work as a Software Developer at [Rapid River Software](http://rrsoft.co), a fully remote position that sees me working with US based companies. For more information about what I do and have done, check out my [projects](/projects) page. If you'd like to get in touch email me at [calum@calumhalcrow.com](mailto:calum@calumhalcrow.com).
