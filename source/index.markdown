Hi, my name is Calum and I'm a programmer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

I was born and brought up in [Shetland](http://shetland.org), Scotland. I studied Mathematics at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk), but after graduating felt a change of direction was necessary so [moved into web development](http://nbcommunication.com) and programming. My wife and I settled in her [home country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) and currently live in Kuala Lumpur.

I currently work as a Software Developer at [Mindvalley](http://mindvalley.com). For more information about what I do and have done, check out my [projects](/projects) page.
