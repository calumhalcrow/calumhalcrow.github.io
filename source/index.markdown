Hi, my name is Calum and I'm a programmer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I was born and brought up in [Shetland](http://shetland.org), Scotland. After finishing school I went to study Mathematics at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk). After graduating I felt a change of direction was necessary and so [moved into web development](http://nbcommunication.com) and programming. I met my now wife during university and we decided to settle down in [Malaysia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) where she's from. We currently live in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur, and I currently work as a Software Developer at [Mindvalley](http://mindvalley.com). For more information about what I do and have done, check out my [projects](/projects) page.

I like to use simple, lightweight yet powerful development tools. The OS I use is [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) [Linux](http://gnu.org). I do almost everything on a [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/s/bash) shell, use [Vim](http://vim.org) (the last editor you'll ever use) for writing code and [Git](http://git-scm.com)/[Github](http://github.com) for source control.
