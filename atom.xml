    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early in my career I was in a job that had me commuting close to three hours a day. I managed it by reading a lot, but it left me with very little personal time during the working week. Weekends were often spent getting ready for the week ahead. I went to work when everyone else went to work, came home when everyone else came home, went shopping when everyone else went shopping. Wherever I went was busy with people rushing to do the same things I needed to do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Eventually my wife and I moved closer to my office. This made things better for me, but not necessarily for my wife or our personal life. My office was outside the city, and in order to go to most places we wanted to go, we had to make the 30 minute car ride in. My wife had a longer commute to her clients’ locations.</p>

<p>When it came to buying a house, we chose a location based on what would work for us long term, and moved back into the city. I found work not too far from where we lived; 30 minutes by train door to door. Flexi-time helped me manage my work/life balance, but I had always found the office environment distracting and not conducive for work. When I needed to put my head down and get some work done, I worked from home. This helped, but office-centric culture made me feel on the fringes of the social structure that surrounded the company.</p>

<h2>An Alternative</h2>

<p>I had read a lot about remote working. The concept appealed to me for many reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I could cut out my daily commute, leaving more time in the day for other activities.</li>
<li>I could work at times of the day and in environments that would help me be as productive as possible.</li>
<li>I could design my work space around what works best for me.</li>
<li>I could travel out of the city and still work, allowing me to travel for longer and give my itinerary more flexibility.</li>
</ul>


<p>The book <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</a> discusses such advantages in great detail. On top of what’s said in the book and what I listed above, my personal situation also encouraged me to take up such a working style. My wife and I live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and:</p>

<ul>
<li>My wife’s family lives in the countryside. If location was irrelevant to my work, we could visit them for extended periods of time and I could work during the visit.</li>
<li>My family lives in Scotland… (see point above).</li>
<li>We love the idea of country life and wish to settle there. A location-independent job would make this possible.</li>
</ul>


<h2>A Reality</h2>

<p>When <a href="http://marden.org">Nick Marden</a> reached out to me about joining <a href="http://www.rrsoft.co/">Rapid River</a>, his 100% remote software development consulting company, I jumped at the chance to get on board, and since April 2014 I have been working from my home with teams on the other side of the world from me.</p>

<p>When I mention this working arrangement to other people, I often get asked about the difficulties people imagine they’d have if they were in a similar position. Since it’s been over six months since I started, here’s a summary of my experience so far presented by answering some of the questions I often hear:</p>

<h3>Don’t you get lonely without colleagues around you every day?</h3>

<p>On the whole, I don’t get lonely working in this arrangement. I will admit that when working in an office there were times when I enjoyed a random conversation with colleagues. But more often I found the arrangement distracting. I’m not good at small talk or idle gossip, but found myself involved in such activities more often than I cared for. Worse, by actively avoiding the social dynamic in the name of productivity I felt as though I isolated myself and came across as aloof.</p>

<p>Now, between regular conference calls with my team and spending time with my wife, family and friends, I find I get plenty of social interaction. But in case I need more, my schedule now allows me to hook up with groups of people that have similar interests with me. I’ve been keeping my eye on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KLhiking/">KLHiking</a> group for a while now and plan to join one of their hikes in the near future.</p>

<h3>Do you find it hard to balance work and non-work activities? Isn’t being at home too distracting?</h3>

<p>What remote working gives you is more complete control over your schedule. I love this, but the flexibility comes at a price: you must organize your life well. For example, it’s now possible for me to go to the supermarket during office hours (when it’s quiet), but if I want to do that <em>and</em> work eight hours in that day, I have to be organized with my time. It’s very easy to prioritize small day-to-day tasks and end up not having enough time for work. This is something I struggled with initially.</p>

<p>There’s a number of things that can be done to deal with this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep on top of house chores. I dedicate two times of the day to deal with such tasks: first thing in the morning and late in the evening. Think of these times as warm up and cool down periods for cognitive activity. Once I’m ready to start work for the day, our house is in order and hence devoid of distractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a home office. If you have a comfortable, consistent space where you can enter and get to work, once you’re in there and working you’re less likely to find things to distract you.</p></li>
<li><p>Set realistic expectations for the amount of work you can achieve in a particular day and meet them. If you don’t, your attitude towards work will likely be “just do as much as I can”. While that may sound reasonable, it doesn’t set you up to achieve self-appointed goals and can even leave you feeling unsatisfied, as you may feel like you underachieved for that day. Being explicit when planning your day allows you to celebrate achieving those explicit goals. It also keeps you focused on completing them.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>A reality for you too?</h2>

<p>I suspect this style of working isn’t for everyone. It requires a high level of self-decsipline and a desire to be independent. However, I think many developers are attracted to it. Making the jump from the familiar &ldquo;9-5&rdquo; can be difficult though. If you’re toying with the idea of making such a jump and want to talk to someone who’s been though it, I’d be happy to talk to you. Just reach out to me via the contact channels on this site and I’ll respond. I might even be able to hook you up with some work ;&ndash;)</p>

    <id>http://calumhalcrow.com/blog/2014/09/03/export-a-commit-range-to-patch-files</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I found myself in a position where a Git repo I am contributing to was to going to have its history significantly altered. Sensitive information was to be completely removed from the repo, and when done the repo would basically be a single commit on the master branch, with all other branches deleted.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But there were several open pull requests against master that would not get merged before this work was carried out. I had to save the commits in these PRs offline until the repo had been adjusted, then reapply them and re-open the PRs.</p>

<p>Here’s one way that this can be done:</p>

<h2>Commit range to patch files:</h2>

<p>Ensuring you have your topic branch checked out and that it has some commits on it,</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout topic-branch
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git log --oneline origin/master..
</span><span class='line'>898ea0f Adds more padding to footer.
</span><span class='line'>c455b4f Makes header text blue.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>you can make a patch out of each commit with the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch">git format-patch</a> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git format-patch origin/master..
</span><span class='line'>0001-Makes-header-text-blue.patch
</span><span class='line'>0002-Adds-more-padding-to-footer.patch
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For each commit, we now have a patch file that can be saved offline and reapplied later:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls -l *.patch
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--  1 calum  staff  680 Sep  3 08:55 0001-Makes-header-text-blue.patch
</span><span class='line'>-rw-r--r--  1 calum  staff  684 Sep  3 08:55 0002-Adds-more-padding-to-footer.patch
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To reapply, move the patches to a directory outside of the repo (I moved mine to my home dir), checkout master and use the <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-am">git am</a> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mv *.patch ~
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout master
</span><span class='line'>Switched to branch ‘master<span class="err">&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git am ~/*.patch
</span><span class='line'>Applying: Makes header text blue.
</span><span class='line'>Applying: Adds more padding to footer.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now the commits have be reapplied onto master. From here you can create a new branch, push it and re-open your pull requests.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">cancan</a> is an authentication gem for Rails. It can be used to restrict access to certain parts of your web-app based on classifications you give to your users.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You can get it working on your app by following the instructions on its <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan#installation">Github page</a>.</p>

<p>cancan allows you to work with two concepts: roles and abilities. A role is a classification that you give to a set of your users, an ability is something users with that role can do.</p>

<p>At Mindvalley we use cancan in a few of our apps. I&rsquo;m currently working on the next version of Daily, our internal reporting service, and we recently realized that we needed to restrict certain types of users from accessing certain reports. cancan to the rescue!</p>

<p>Daily users fall into three distinct roles: managers, marketers and admins. Marketers will not be able to view certain high-level business reports. Admins on the other hand will be able to access everything and be able to change the role of any user.</p>

<p>The way in which you define and assign roles to your users is left up to you. cancan does not provide functionality of that nature. It&rsquo;s useful however to be able to ask a user instance if it belongs to a particular role (if user.marketer?). This is what we have implemented on Daily.</p>

<p>Once you can ask such questions, you use cancan&rsquo;s Ability class to define abilities for each user role. On Daily we have something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">admin?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:manage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">elsif</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">manager?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:manage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">cannot</span> <span class="ss">:update</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">User</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">elsif</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">marketer?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">can</span> <span class="ss">:manage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:all</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">cannot</span> <span class="ss">:update</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">User</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">cannot</span> <span class="ss">:bundles_report</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">ProductLinesClient</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p><p>This is (almost) understandable just by reading the code out load. &ldquo;Admins can manage everything.&rdquo; &ldquo;Managers can manage everything but they cannot update users&rdquo;. You may be wondering why I&rsquo;ve repeated &ldquo;can :manage, :all&rdquo; three times here. Surely that&rsquo;s not very <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>. Well, I feel it reads more naturally this way, and doesn&rsquo;t allow for a user with a rogue role to slip into the system and have access to everything (prizes up for grabs for better solutions though; just send me a pull request ;&ndash;).</p>

<p>The reason I said this is &ldquo;almost&rdquo; readable is because of the last &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; statement. &ldquo;Marketers cannot bundles-report a product-lines-client.&rdquo; What is that supposed to mean?? Well, technically this relates back to the specific method &ldquo;bundles_report&rdquo; on the &ldquo;ProductLinesClient&rdquo; class that returns the report that marketers are not allowed to access. But this unclear naming suggests a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/code-smells.html">code smell</a>; the way we&rsquo;ve arranged our model classes doesn&rsquo;t map clearly to the types of data we&rsquo;re reporting on. We&rsquo;ll need to look into nipping this naming confusion in the bud in the near future while Daily&rsquo;s code is still new and easily changeable&hellip;</p>

<p>Up next week: saner model structure with the help of <a href="https://github.com/rails/activeresource">ActiveResource</a>? :&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often tell friends that I cannot listen to a book being read as an audiobook, but must read the words myself. I see this is pushing vs. pushing the book&rsquo;s content: listening is the audio player pushing the words to me; reading is me pulling the words at my own pace.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Often the same is true for knowledge sharing. Within a creative work environment there is frequently the need to share knowledge about new code/systems/adopted techniques/whatever. I&rsquo;ve noticed that people often think that the push model is the most efficient way to get this new information across to the team. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve give a quick presentation on the subject&rdquo;, but then get frustrated when a team member starts asking about the material covered a week later.</p>

<p>I see this week-later asking as that person starting to pull. They need to actually work with this new thing, so their mind is attuned to learning about it. I&rsquo;d bet in most cases the person is in a much better state to really learn the new thing at that point.</p>

<p>The initial push presentation (or email) gets the information out there. It highlights to everyone that if they need to do X, they can roughly do it in this way, or ask the presenter later. Don&rsquo;t be too frustrated if people begin to ask about stuff you already iterated during such a session. And maybe some accessible written documentation would provide a middle ground.</p>

    <id>http://calumhalcrow.com/blog/2012/07/29/becoming-a-polyglot-programmer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[I&rsquo;m referring to being a programmer who is comfortable using several languages here, rather than a system built with several different programming languages.]</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I spend most of my time programming in only two languages: Perl and JavaScript. I often feel I&rsquo;d like to learn a few more, or at least sample a few more. I often find this hard to do however as step-by-step beginner tutorials don&rsquo;t rub off on me too well, and taking on a full side-project can be overkill when all you want to do is try out a language (I&rsquo;m slowing becoming more and more familiar with the Python universe because of one; not necessarily a bad thing!).</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve recently discovered a way to try new languages which involves solving actual problems: <a href="http://projecteuler.net">projecteuler.net</a>. Project Euler contains many small yet challenging mathematical problems, in a form similar to many online coding contests (like Google CodeJam). You are given a problem, have to submit the answer, and are immediately told if you are correct. This is generally good for keeping your problem solving skills sharp, but the real benefit for me is that I can attempt to solve each problem with a different language! So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to try&hellip;</p>

<p>Why is this a good thing to do? Once you&rsquo;ve learned one or two decent general-purpose languages, why bother to know about others? Well, I see a few advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Becoming familiar with other languages can cause you to look at problems a little differently, and to look at the problems you solve with the language you are most familiar with a little differently also. You may find that a common approach used in a newly sampled language fits well with a problem you are tackling in your day job. A paradigm shift (<abbr title="Object Oriented">OO</abbr> &ndash;> functional or asynchronous event loops) may surprise you when you learn what is possible with altogether new ways of approaching problems.</li>
<li>Maybe there&rsquo;s a language out there that&rsquo;s just right for you. The way the syntax and external resources have been designed seems to go well with your way of thinking, and maybe its community resonates well with your personality. Maybe you&rsquo;d be more productive using it. And maybe you&rsquo;ll never discover it.</li>
<li>If you decide to learn a new stack by say writing a Rails app, you may find you don&rsquo;t do a lot of work with the underlying language. Your learning will lack a solid foundation, leaving you confused in places and with gaps in your understanding.</li>
<li>When job offers come up you&rsquo;ll probably know something about the language the company is working with, and you&rsquo;ll have a base to continue to learn from (if you get the job that is!).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s just good fun!</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve just started this, and so far have solved four problems in three languages (Perl, Python, Ruby). I&rsquo;ll probably solve two or three problems before moving onto a fourth, and will deliberately make my programs reasonably well designed (by using OOP when available, passing arguments via the command line rather than hard-coding them) in an attempt to get more exposure to each language.</p>

<p>I tend to find I actually learn something when I do things this way. When I have a problem to solve, I go out and look for the syntax necessary to implement my algorithm. When I&rsquo;ve completed a problem, I plan to go off and read over the documentation of the language I used. I find that once I have a reference point (the work I just did solving the problem) I can take in the documentation much more easily. If I really liked the language, I could then decide to learn further by taking on a side-project (e.g. if I liked Ruby perhaps I could build a Rails web-app).</p>

<p>Hopefully in a few months time I&rsquo;ll be familiar with quite a few new programming languages, and maybe you will be too!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&hellip;just cut out a lot of the noise. Try taking the following steps:</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>Unsubscribe from friends who get on your nerves.</li>
<li>Turn off notifications from any groups you like to be part of, but update often causing constant notifications.</li>
<li>Subscribe to &ldquo;important updates only&rdquo; from friends who you like to hear from but are a bit too chatty.</li>
<li>Block anything &ldquo;from Twitter&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Generally block/unsubscribe from any Group/Page that you like, but you don&rsquo;t need to hear from day to day.</li>
</ul>


<p>Suddenly your feed will be very quiet, and you&rsquo;ll find checking it once in a while will be a small pleasure rather than a constant catch-up reviewing posts that generally get on your nerves.</p>
