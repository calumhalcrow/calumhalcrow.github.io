    <p>Here&rsquo;s a run-down of some of the projects I&rsquo;ve been involved in. The &ldquo;Tech stack&rdquo; underneath each lists major technologies used in the project, in particular the ones I am most familiar with.</p>

<h3><a href="http://mindvalley.com">Mindvalley</a></h3>

<p>Up until April 2014 I worked at Mindvalley, developing web-apps that supported their core business. Because Mindvalley market and sell wellness products, their portfolio of internal apps include: sophisticated campaign tracking services, an e-commerce platform, <abbr title="Email Service Provider">ESP</abbr> integrations and more, all of which I helped develop.</p>

<h3><a href="http://binary.com">Binary.com</a></h3>

<p>I worked on Binary.com, a provider of fixed-odd financial contracts, as an employee of Regent Markets (the site&rsquo;s owner) for six years. The service has a large user base, and I worked to maintain and bring it forward. I learned a lot about the dynamics of a software company during my time there, from how to have the discipline to write high quality code when everyone wants things done yesterday, to the difficulties of managing a team of developers in a fast-paced company with (seemingly) tonnes of priorities. Definitely my pragmatism, attitude toward Getting Things Done, and general maturity as a software developer was carved into me at RMG.</p>

<h3><a href="http://bukitgasingtrails.info">BukitGasingTrails.info</a></h3>

<p>This webpage shows a map of Bukit Gasing, a forest park located between <abbr title="Kuala Lumpur">KL</abbr> and <abbr title="Petaling Jaya">PJ</abbr>. I started going to the park shortly after moving to the surrounding area. After visiting several times I felt I wanted to see a map of the trails, but when I searched the web I couldn&rsquo;t find anything accurate. That plus being asked for directions a few times, and the existence of some groups fighting to stop further real-estate development on the park&rsquo;s fringes, I decided that having some accessible, accurate information about the park&rsquo;s features online would be beneficial to the community. After battling with the Google Maps JS API, Ruby&rsquo;s Jekyll and writing a Ruby module (with an RSpec unit test!) that puts together the map&rsquo;s data into a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file, the site was good to go.</p>

<p>I should add that I originally thought Rails would be a good choice to power the back-end (there are quite a lot of map nodes that need to be stored somewhere). It turned out that Rails wasn&rsquo;t a good choice, and I ended up storing my map data on a &ldquo;My Maps&rdquo; Google Map, exporting the map to KML and parsing it into the format I wanted with a Ruby module. The one thing I got out of that endeavour though was experience with Rails! I actually grew very fond of the framework and wouldn&rsquo;t mind using it in some other projects.</p>

<h3><a href="http://kudosenglishlearning.com">KudosEnglishLearning.com</a></h3>

<p>This is my wife&rsquo;s business website. She is an English Trainer, based in the Klang Valley area but often working across Peninsular Malaysia. The site from a technical point of view lacks bells and whistles, but I see that as a good thing. Easy to maintain, easy for visitors to find the information they&rsquo;re looking for, or get in touch. There are some subtle yet interesting design elements that can be found if you look for them: Web Fonts, CSS3 gradients and HTML5 mark-up. (Oh, and I designed the site myself; which I mention not so much as a complement to my design skills but more as an explanation as to why it looks as it does :&ndash;)</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/calumhalcrow/campr">Campr</a></h3>

<p>Campr is a webapp that facilitates networking at events. It allows you to see everyone who is at the event you are attending, along with a little bit of information about each person. Based on this, you can single out people you may want to get to know better. The project was started at <a href="http://hack.weekend.my">Hack Weekend</a>, a delightful hackathon series that takes place every quarter in Kuala Lumpur. Working on Campr was a great learning experience, but we&rsquo;ve ceased development on the project.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webcampkl">WebCamp KL</a></h3>

<p>WebCamp is a monthly meet-up of web professionals based in and around Kuala Lumpur. I am a fairly active member of the community, and have helped in minor ways to organise some of the group&rsquo;s events.</p>

<h3><a href="http://cunningsburghheritage.com">CunningsburghHeritage.com</a></h3>

<p>A site that I set up some time ago for the Cunningsburgh History Group, a community-based organisation from the village where I grew up. I handed over content administration to the group themselves, so the site largely runs itself.</p>
